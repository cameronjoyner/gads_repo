# How to Convert HTML to Plain Text Using OpenAI

This guide will help you turn HTML files into plain text using a tool called OpenAI. 
The process involves reading HTML files from a folder, sending the content to OpenAI, and saving the plain text in another folder.

## What You Need

- A computer with Python installed (version 3.7 or higher)
- A tool called pip to install packages

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Open your command line tool.** This could be Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal.
2. **Go to your project folder.** For example:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. **Create a new environment.** You can call it `venv` or any name you like:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Turn on the environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Installing Necessary Tools

Once your environment is active, install the required tools by typing:

```
pip install openai
```

## Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Sign up or log in** to your OpenAI account at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).
2. **Go to the API section** of your account.
3. **Create a new API key** and copy it.
4. **Replace the placeholder in the script** with your actual API key:
   ```python
   openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

## How to Run the Program

1. **Make sure your HTML files** are in the `HTML_DOCS` folder inside your project.
2. **Run the script** by typing:
   ```
   python professor_gad_weiss.py
   ```

## What to Expect

- The program will look at each HTML file in the `HTML_DOCS` folder.
- It will save the plain text version in the `LLM_OUTPUT` folder with the same name as the original HTML file but ending in `.txt`.
- You will see messages in the console showing the progress, including which file is being processed and where the output is saved.

### Example

If you have a file named `ir_1.html`, the program will create a file called `ir_1.txt` in the `LLM_OUTPUT` folder, containing the plain text from the HTML.

## Important Notes

- Keep your API key safe and do not share it publicly.
- Using the OpenAI API may cost money, so keep an eye on your usage.
