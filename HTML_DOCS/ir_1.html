The two companies will focus initially on Jetex locations across the Middle East, where Joby plans to install its Global Electric Aviation Charging System (GEACS), to support Joby operations that will connect Jetex passengers to a network of vertiports, offering efficient and sustainable travel across the region and between Emirates.

</p>
<p>
“At Jetex, sustainability is a key focus of our strategy, and our partnership with Joby represents an important step forward in achieving our vision of greener skies,” says Adel Mardini, Founder &amp; CEO of Jetex. “We are committed to driving innovation that reduces our industry’s environmental impact, and integrating Joby’s electric air taxis into our network allows us to deliver cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable travel experiences, starting in the UAE.”

In Abu Dhabi, Joby has signed a multilateral agreement with the Department of Municipalities and Transport - Abu Dhabi (DMT), the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (DED) and the Department of Culture and Tourism - Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) that lays the groundwork for Joby to establish and scale air taxi services in the Emirate and unlocks the potential for inter-emirate services.
