The maintenance training program, which trained several U.S. Air Force service members including a flight test pilot and aircraft maintainers, focused on the specifics of inspecting and maintaining Joby’s electric aircraft. It was completed as part of the Company’s existing contract with AFWERX Agility Prime.

The four-week program took place at Joby’s flight test and manufacturing facilities in Marina, California, and was based on the Aircraft Maintenance Manual developed by Joby as part of its ongoing work towards aircraft type certification with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The program included classroom instruction as well as hands-on completion of inspections and pre-flight checks on Joby’s production prototype aircraft.

“We’re pleased to have successfully completed another engagement with the U.S. Air Force, providing the government with a technical overview of electric aircraft maintenance operations while we received feedback from experienced service members to further hone our in-house maintenance training program,” said Bonny Simi, President of Operations at Joby.

In April 2023, Joby announced that four U.S. Air Force pilots had completed pilot training and become the first Air Force personnel to fly an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft as sole remote pilot-in-command through the full flight envelope, including transition from vertical to wingborne flight.

The Joby electric air taxi is designed to carry a pilot and four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph, offering high-speed mobility with a fraction of the noise produced by helicopters and zero operating emissions.
