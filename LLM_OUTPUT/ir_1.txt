Joby and Jetex announced a strategic partnership to bring seamless connectivity and sustainable air taxi service to Jetex customers across the Middle East.

“At Jetex, sustainability is a key focus of our strategy, and our partnership with Joby represents an important step forward in achieving our vision of greener skies,” says Adel Mardini, Founder & CEO of Jetex. “We are committed to driving innovation that reduces our industry’s environmental impact, and integrating Joby’s electric air taxis into our network allows us to deliver cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable travel experiences, starting in the UAE.”

Jetex’s VIP Terminals provide seamless access to key financial, tourist, and entertainment destinations within the UAE. The partnership with Joby highlights Jetex’s ongoing efforts to drive eco-conscious advancements in private aviation.

“Jetex’s exceptional operational standards and commitment to sustainability make them an ideal partner as we work to redefine urban air mobility,” says JoeBen Bevirt, Founder and CEO of Joby Aviation.

Joby recently announced that Skyports, Joby’s launch infrastructure partner in Dubai, has begun construction of the first vertiport in Joby’s planned Dubai air taxi network, located at Dubai International Airport.
